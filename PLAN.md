# Brelly implementation plan

Brelly shows weather (NEA's `data.gov.sg` in Singapore, Open-Meteo elsewhere —
see [round 19](NOTES.md#round-19--weather-works-outside-singapore)) for
user-planned itinerary stops (via Google Places). This file is the task list
only.

## Before you start

- `NOTES.md` — [the traps](NOTES.md#read-this-before-writing-code-here) (tests,
  the zustand store, date keys, NEA response shapes, Expo config plugins,
  Firestore/cloud sync) and [what is already built](NOTES.md#built-so-far). Read
  the traps before touching any of those areas; read the round history for why
  something is the way it is.
- `UX.md` — open UX issues with per-item status. Check before changing a screen,
  and tick the item when you address it.

## Verification gate

Run before checking off any item below, and after every change:

```
npx tsc --noEmit
yarn lint
yarn test
```

All three must be clean — `yarn lint` runs with `--max-warnings 0`, so a
single warning fails it. See the `implement-feature` skill
(`.claude/skills/implement-feature/SKILL.md`) for the full policy: zero
lint warnings/errors, and a test for every new component and function.

## Tasks

_Nothing open._ The last round is written up in
[NOTES.md](NOTES.md#round-34--the-permission-primer-app-review-rejected-and-the-dead-ends-behind-it).

Finished work moves into `NOTES.md` — the round history there says why each
thing is the way it is. New work is added back here as a task, not as a
finished description.
